LTTng system call tracing

1) lttng-syscall-extractor

You need to build a kernel with CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS=y for extraction. Apply
the linker patch to get your kernel to keep the system call metadata after boot.
Then build and load the LTTng syscall extractor module. The module will fail to
load (this is expected). See the dmesg output for system call metadata.

2) Generate system call TRACE_EVENT().

Take the dmesg metadata and feed it to lttng-syscalls-generate-headers.sh, e.g.,
from the instrumentation/syscalls directory:

sh lttng-syscalls-generate-headers.sh 3.0.4 x86-64-syscalls-3.0.4

After these are created, we just need to follow the new system call additions,
no need to regenerate the whole thing, since system calls are only appended to.
