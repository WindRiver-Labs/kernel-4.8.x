Version 0.9 (unreleased)

* Added additional test tools:
  - sha_speed does performance testing of SHA1 and SHA256
  - hashcrypt_speed additionally encrypts with AES128 and AES256

* Allow updating the IV in userspace via the COP_FLAG_WRITE_IV
flag.

* Export the alignmask in an OCF compatible way.

* Fix for kernel crash on passing incorrect session ID.

* Added CIOCGSESSINFO to export additional information
for each session.

Version 0.8 (released 2010-11-06)

* Made cryptodev aware of alignment constraints.

* Added support for CRYPTO_AES_ECB.

* Added asynchronous operation support using
  CIOCASYNCCRYPT, CIOCASYNCFETCH ioctls and poll().

Version 0.7 (released 2010-10-08)

* Added COP_FLAG_FINAL to make multi-update
more efficient.

* Added CRIOGET_NOT_NEEDED definition to allow
users of the API to distinguish from the bare
OpenBSD API that requires the CRIOGET.

Version 0.6 (released 2010-09-16)

* multi-update support for hash calculation using
the new flag COP_FLAG_UPDATE.

* Relicensed under GPLv2.

* Added AES-CTR.

* Corrected fallback to non-zero copy when referenced
pages were not writable.

Version 0.5 (released 2010-07-06)

* Corrected issue with zero copy on multiple pages.

* Fallback to normal operation if user pages cannot be
mapped.

Version 0.4 (released 2010-07-03)

* Internal engine supports operations with zero copy from
user space. 

Version 0.3 (released 2010-06-19)

* Corrected bug when initializing unsupported algorithms.

Version 0.2 (released 2010-06-18)

* Added compat_ioctl() to allow working on systems where userspace is 32bits
and kernel is operating in 64bit mode (Phil Sutter)

* Added several sanity checks to input.
