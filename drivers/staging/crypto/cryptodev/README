This is a /dev/crypto device driver, equivalent to those in OpenBSD or
FreeBSD. The main idea is to access of existing ciphers in kernel space 
from userspace, thus enabling re-use of a hardware implementation of a
cipher.

Since version 0.4 /dev/crypto uses zero copy for operations between user-space
and kernel space. We are not aware of any accelerators that this might cause
a problem. If it does define DISABLE_ZCOPY in cryptodev_int.h recompile
and let us know.
