This is a /dev/crypto device driver, equivalent to those in OpenBSD or
FreeBSD. The main idea is to access of existing ciphers in kernel space 
from userspace, thus enabling re-use of a hardware implementation of a
cipher.

It was initially written for linux 2.6.8 by Michal Ludvig. Compatibility
fixes for *BSD cryptodev as well as Was ported to 2.6.27 blkcipher API 
by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos. Initial blkcipher async API porting by
Michael Weiser.
