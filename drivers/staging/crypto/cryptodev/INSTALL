=== Installation instructions ===

Simply run:
$ make
# make install

The first command compiles the code and generates the kernel module
and the latter installs the header files and the kernel module.

After that you should set your system to load the kernel module on system
load. In most systems this can be done as:
# echo cryptodev >>/etc/modules
