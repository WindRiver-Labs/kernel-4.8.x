Decompression Compression Engine (DCE)
	The DCE is a freescale hardware acceelrator that can be used to offload
	compression and decompression operations that use the DEFLATE algorithm

	The DCE is represented by objects called DPDCEI. All modules that do
	compression or decompression must get a handle to a dpdcei. All work
	necessary to get access and share DPDCEI objects is simplified in the
	DCE API docuemented in dce.h
