/**
 * rpmsg_create_ept() - create a new rpmsg_endpoint
 * @rpdev: rpmsg channel device
 * @cb: rx callback handler
 * @priv: private data for the driver's use
 * @chinfo: channel_info with the local rpmsg address to bind with @cb
 *
 * Every rpmsg address in the system is bound to an rx callback (so when
 * inbound messages arrive, they are dispatched by the rpmsg bus using the
 * appropriate callback handler) by means of an rpmsg_endpoint struct.
 *
 * This function allows drivers to create such an endpoint, and by that,
 * bind a callback, and possibly some private data too, to an rpmsg address
 * (either one that is known in advance, or one that will be dynamically
 * assigned for them).
 *
 * Simple rpmsg drivers need not call rpmsg_create_ept, because an endpoint
 * is already created for them when they are probed by the rpmsg bus
 * (using the rx callback provided when they registered to the rpmsg bus).
 *
 * So things should just work for simple drivers: they already have an
 * endpoint, their rx callback is bound to their rpmsg address, and when
 * relevant inbound messages arrive (i.e. messages which their dst address
 * equals to the src address of their rpmsg channel), the driver's handler
 * is invoked to process it.
 *
 * That said, more complicated drivers might do need to allocate
 * additional rpmsg addresses, and bind them to different rx callbacks.
 * To accomplish that, those drivers need to call this function.
 *
 * Drivers should provide their @rpdev channel (so the new endpoint would belong
 * to the same remote processor their channel belongs to), an rx callback
 * function, an optional private data (which is provided back when the
 * rx callback is invoked), and an address they want to bind with the
 * callback. If @addr is RPMSG_ADDR_ANY, then rpmsg_create_ept will
 * dynamically assign them an available rpmsg address (drivers should have
 * a very good reason why not to always use RPMSG_ADDR_ANY here).
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the endpoint on success, or NULL on error.
