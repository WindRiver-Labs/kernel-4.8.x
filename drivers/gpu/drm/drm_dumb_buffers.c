/**
 * drm_mode_create_dumb_ioctl - create a dumb backing storage buffer
 * @dev: DRM device
 * @data: ioctl data
 * @file_priv: DRM file info

 * This creates a new dumb buffer in the driver's backing storage manager (GEM,
 * TTM or something else entirely) and returns the resulting buffer handle. This
 * handle can then be wrapped up into a framebuffer modeset object.
 *
 * Note that userspace is not allowed to use such objects for render

 * case.
 *
 * Called by the user via ioctl.

 * Returns:
 * Zero on success, negative errno on failure.
