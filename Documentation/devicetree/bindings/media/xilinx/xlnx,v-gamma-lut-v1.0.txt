Xilinx Video Gamma Correction IP
------------------------------------------------
The Xilinx Video Gamma Correction IP is used to provide RGB gamma correction.
The IP provides a look up table for each R,G and B components.

It takes an a 24bit RBG streaming input and provides a gamma corrected 24 bit RGB format.
Currently, the driver supports only the following configurations :
	- 8 bit (bits per pixel)

All other configurations are not supported.

The V4L2 subdevice driver exposes a control interface through which you can specify
gamma values for R,G and B components individually.

Example :
A value of  1 represents a gamma of 0.1
A value of 10 represents a gamma of 1.0 (default)
A value of 40 represents a gamma of 4.0 (maximum)

Note : A gamma of value 1.0 is a linear curve or pass through design, with
no corrective action.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-gamma-lut-v1.0".

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- clocks: Reference to the video core clock.

- reset-gpios: Specifier for a GPIO that assert gamma IP (AP_RST_N) reset.

- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The scaler has an input port (0) and an output port (1).


Required port properties:
- reg: This value represents the media pad of the V4L2 sub-device.
  A Sink Pad is represented by reg = <0>
  A Source Pad is represented by reg = <1>

- xlnx,video-width: Video width as defined in video.txt


Example :

	gamma_lut_1: gamma_lut_1@0xa0080000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-gamma-lut-v1.0";
		reg = <0x0 0xa0080000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&vid_stream_clk>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 83 1>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				gamma_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&demosaic_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				gamma_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&csc_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
