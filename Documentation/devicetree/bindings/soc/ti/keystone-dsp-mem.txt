TI Keystone DSP Memory Mapping Device
=====================================

Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

The Keystone DSP Memory Mapping Device is a device node used to represent
the memory regions that can be mapped into userspace for providing direct
user-mode access to regions for the purposes of shared memory communication
with the DSP remote processor devices on the SoC. It can also be used for
supporting user-space based loading of the DSP remoteproc devices.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible : Should be "ti,keystone-dsp-mem"
- reg        : An array of memory regions, each region represented by a tuple
               of the region's start address and the size of the region.

Example:
--------
	/* K2HK EVM */
	soc {
		mpm_mem: dspmem {
			compatible = "ti,keystone-dsp-mem";
			reg  = <0x0c000000 0x00600000>, /* MSMC Memory */
			       <0xa0000000 0x20000000>; /* DDR Memory */
		};
	};
