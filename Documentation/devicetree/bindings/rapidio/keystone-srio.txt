This document describes the device tree bindings associated with the KeyStone
Serial RapidIO driver support.

Required properties
-------------------

#address-cells
#size-cells:      Should be '1' if the device has sub-nodes with 'reg' property.
reg:              Address and length of the register set for the SRIO subsystem
		  on the SOC.
reg-names:        Indicates the name of the various register ranges defined with
		  the "reg" property above. There are three mandatory ranges of
		  registers:
		   - RapidIO registers ("rio")
		   - boot configuration registers (for JTAGID and K1 SerDes
                     setup) ("boot_config")
		   - SerDes configuration registers ("serdes")
clocks:           Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
clock-names:      Names of clocks corresponding to IDs in the clock property.
compatible:       Should be "ti,keystone-rapidio".
interrupts:       The two IRQ definitions for:
		   - RIO special interrupts (doorbells, errors, port-writes in,
		   ...)
                   - LSU completions

Optional properties
-------------------

dma-coherent:     Indicates if DirectIO operations support hw cache-coherency.
		  On KeyStone platforms it is recommended to set this property
		  when running on ARM cores.
keystone2-serdes: Indicates that the driver needs to use KeyStone 2 SerDes
		  initialization. If not specified, it will be KeyStone 1
		  initialization instead.
baudrate:         This the lane baudrate configuration number (from 0 to 3).
		  If not specified the baudrate configuration 3 will be used
                  (5 Gbps).
path-mode:        This is the SerDes lanes to ports configuration number (from 0
                  to 4). If not specified the mode 0 will be used (4 ports in
                  1x).
port-register-timeout:
		  This is the delay in seconds for waiting the port registration
                  at startup. if not specified a default 30 seconds value will
                  be used.
ports:            This is the bitfield of RapidIO port(s) to probe at startup.
		  If not specified, no port will be used.
ports-remote:     Allows to explicitly specify the remote port number (of the
                  link partner) for each local port. There is one value per port
                  for the 4 ports.
		  If not specified, the remote ports will be detected at startup
                  using the peer Switch Port Information CAR register if
                  available (meaning that the link partner implements such
                  register).
		  The remote ports are needed for the software error recovery
                  process.
dev-id-size:      RapidIO common transport system size:
                   0 - Small size, 8-bit deviceID fields, 256 devices.
                   1 - Large size, 16-bit deviceID fields, 65536 devices.
		  If not specified 0 (8-bit) value will be used.
lsu:              Start and end indexes of the LSU range that will be used for
                  DirectIO transfers and maintenance requests. Using multiple
                  LSUs allows to allocate one for maintenance packets and
                  different LSUs for each DMA channels used for DirectI/O
                  transfers increasing the parallelism capabilities.
                  If not specified LSU 0 will be used for all kind of transfers.
num-dio-channels  Number of virtual DMA channels available for DirectI/O
                  transfers. Note that one is always reserved for doorbells
                  purpose. Default is 8 if not specified.
rxu-map-range:    Define the range (start and end values) of RXU mapping entries
                  that will be used for MP receive. Range must start from 0 and
                  end up to 63. If not specified the full range will be used by
		  Linux(0 to 63).
num-mboxes:       Number of receive mailboxes used for MP. If not specified,
                  only one mailbox will be used.
pkt-forward:      This allows to define the routing table for hardware packet
		  forwarding. There are 8 entries in the table. Each entry
                  starts with the lower DeviceID boundary, then the upper
                  DeviceID boundary and the output port to route packets whose
                  DestID falls within the described range.
		  For example, '0x3 0x3 1' will forward incoming packets with
		  DestID 0x3 to port 1.
		  All the 8 entries must be referenced with the 3 values.

SerDes optional properties
--------------------------

These properties are used to tune the KeyStone 2 SerDes hardware parameters and
coefficients. For more information please refer to KeyStone II Architecture
Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) User Guide (SPRUHO3) available on www.ti.com.

serdes-1lsb:      Allows to set the TX driver 1 lsb pre emphasis setting for
                  KeyStone 2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value
		  is 0.
serdes-c1:        Allows to override value of TX driver C1 coefficient for
		  KeyStone 2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value
		  if not specified is 6 for 3.125Gbps and 4 for other baudrates.
serdes-c2:        Allows to override value of TX driver C2 coefficient for
		  KeyStone 2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value
		  is 0 if not specified.
serdes-cm:	  Allows to override value of TX driver CM coefficient for
		  KeyStone 2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value
		  is 0.
serdes-att:       Allows to set attenuator setting of TX driver for KeyStone 2
		  SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value is 12 if
		  not specified.
serdes-vreg:      Allows to set regulator voltage setting for TX driver for
		  KeyStone 2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value
		  is 4 if not specified.
serdes-vdreg:     Allows to set lane regulator output voltage setting for TX
		  driver for KeyStone 2. Default value is 1 (VNOM) if not
		  specified.
serdes-rx-att-start:
                  Allows to set attenuator start value of RX driver for Keystone
		  2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value is 3.
serdes-rx-boost-start:
                  Allows to set attenuator start value of RX driver for Keystone
		  2 SerDes. There is one value per lane. Default value is 3.
serdes-rx-att:    Allows to set attenuator static value of RX driver for
		  Keystone 2 SerDes. If set to -1, dynamic calibration is used
		  instead. There is one value per lane. Default value is -1.
serdes-rx-boost:  Allows to set attenuator start value of RX driver for Keystone
		  2 SerDes. If set to -1, dynamic calibration is used instead.
                  There is one value per lane. Default value is -1.

Sub-nodes
---------

Each mailbox (according to num-mboxes) must be added as subnodes "mbox-%d" with
%d the mailbox number (from 0 to n).
This sub-node has the following properties:

rx-channel:       The packet DMA channel associated to this receive mailbox.
		  This property is mandatory and must refer to a specified
		  'navigator-dma-names' DMA client resource like specified in
		  the Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/
		  keystone-navigator-dma.txt file
rx-pool:	  This mandatory property defines the pool of descriptors that
		  will be used for the receive mailbox. The first parameter is
		  the size of descriptor, the second is the region Id where to
		  get descriptors for receive DMA.
rx-queue:         This property defines the hw queue Id used for receive.
		  If not specified a QPEND queue will be allocated by the
		  kernel.
rx-queue-depth:   This can be at present a maximum of 4 queues per packet DMA
		  channel. We can specify here the number of descriptors for
		  each queue.
		  If not specified only one queue of depth of 128 will be used.
rx-buffer-size:   For each receive queue, we can specify the buffer size.
		  Default is 4096 bytes if not specified.
tx-channel:       This is the packet DMA channel name associated with this
		  mailbox for transmit. This property is mandatory and works
		  like the rx-channel property.
tx-queue:         This mandatory property defines the hw transmit queue Id.
		  This must be set in accordance to the Packet DMA channel
		  used in transmit. Check the KeyStone SRIO hw documentation
		  for more information.
tx-completion-queue:
	          This property defines the hw queue Id used for transmit
		  completion. If not specified a QPEND queue will be allocated
		  by the  kernel.
tx-garbage-queue:
	          This property defines the hw queue Id used for transmit
		  errors. If not specified a QPEND queue will be allocated
		  by the  kernel.
tx-queue-depth:   Number of descriptors for the transmit queue. Default is 128
                  descriptors if not specified
stream-id:        If specified, the mailbox will be mapped to the indicated
		  stream ID and packet type 9 will be used instead of packet
                  type 11.
