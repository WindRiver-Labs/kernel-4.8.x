* LSI Fast Ethernet Controller (FEMAC)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "lsi,axm-mdio"
- reg : Address and length of the register set.
- #address-cells : Must be 1.
- #size-cells : Must be 0.

Optional properties:
- lsi,mdio-clk-offset : Set value used to offset the MDIO output signal. A
value of N means the MDIO output signal is held for (N + 1) clk_per units long.
- lsi,mdio-clk-period : Set value used to offset the MDC signal. A value of N
means the MDC signal is 2 x (N + 1) clk_per units long.

Example:

mdio@2010090000 {
	compatible = "lsi,axm-mdio";
	reg = <0x20 0x10090000 0 0x1000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	phy0: ethernet-phy@1e {
		reg = <0x1e>;
	};
};
