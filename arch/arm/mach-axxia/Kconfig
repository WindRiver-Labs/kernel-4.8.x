	  The LSI Axxia platforms can have up to four clusters, each having
	  four cores (so a total of 16 cores). This requires the use of a
	  distributed interrupt system in lieu of of a single ARM GIC.

	  This option enables support for this multi-cluster setup.

	  The LSI Axxia platforms require a Flattened Device Tree to be passed
	  to the kernel.

	  If your bootloader supports Flattened Device Tree based booting,
	  say Y here.
